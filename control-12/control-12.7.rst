Dependencies

* Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory
* Safeguard 2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
* Safeguard 12.5: Centralize Network Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing (AAA)

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV1`: Enterprise Asset Inventory
#. :code:`GV5`: Authorized Software Inventory
#. :code:`GV38`: AAA services within the enterprise
#. :code:`GV37`: Network infrastructure configuration standards

Operations
----------
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV1` to identify and enumerate remote enterprise assets :code:`GV39` (M1)
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV1` and Input 2 :code:`GV5` to identify and enumerate all VPN devices and software (M2)
#. Use the output of Operation 2 and Input 4 :code:`GV37` to check configuration of VPN
	#. Identify and enumerate VPN devices and software properly configured to require authentication prior to granting access (M3)
	#. Identify and enumerate VPN devices and software not properly configured to require authentication prior to granting access (M4)
#. For each asset identified in Operation 1, check if is covered by a VPN device or software identified in Operation 3.1
	#. Identify and enumerate assets that are covered by a VPN (M5)
	#. Identify and enumerate assets that are not covered by a VPN (M6)
#. Use Input 3 :code:`GV38` and Input 4 :code:`GV37` to check configuration of AAA services
	#. Identify and enumerate AAA services properly configured to require authentication prior to granting access (M7)
	#. Identify and enumerate AAA services not properly configured to require authentication prior to granting access (M8)
#. For each asset indentified in Operation 1, check if it is covered an AAA service identified in Operation 5.1 
	#. Identify and enumerate assets that are covered by an AAA service (M9)
	#. Identify and enumerate assets that are not covered by an AAA service (M10)
#. Compare the output of Operation 4.1 and 6.1
	#. Identify and enumerate assets covered by both VPN and AAA (M1)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of remote enterprise assets
* M2 = Count of VPN devices and software
* M3 = Count of properly configured VPN devices and sofware
* M4 = Count of improperly configured VPN devices and software
* M5 = Count of remote assets covered by a properly configured VPN
* M6 = Count of remote assets not covered by a properly configured VPN
* M7 = Count of properly configured AAA services 
* M8 = Count of improperly configured AAA services
* M9 = Count of remote assets covered by a properly configured AAA service 
* M10 = Count of remote assets not covered by a properly configured AAA service
* M11 = Count of remote assets covered by both VPN and AAA
* M12 = Count of AAA services within the enterprise
